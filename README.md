# Iterative Descriptive Statistics

This repository provides an iterative algorithm for online descriptive statistics calculation, allowing for efficient computation of statistics as new data points arrive.

## Contents

- **MATLAB Files:**
  - **[iterative_descriptive_statistics_wo_arr.m](iterative_desrciptive_statistics_wo_arr.m)**: MATLAB implementation of the iterative descriptive statistics algorithm.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB (for running the `.m` files)

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mincasurong/Iterative_descriptive_statistics.git
    cd Iterative_descriptive_statistics
    ```

2. Open the `.m` file in MATLAB and run it to see the results of the iterative descriptive statistics calculation.

### Example

The provided MATLAB file demonstrates how to calculate mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis iteratively for a stream of data.

## Reference

This implementation is based on the method described by John D. Cook in [this article](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/skewness_kurtosis/).
